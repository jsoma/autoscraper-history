# GitHub AutoScraper + history keeper

Using GitHub Actions and Python, this repo automatically scrapes the content of the BBC's homepage every 10 minutes and saves it [right into the repo itself](https://github.com/jsoma/autoscraper-bbc/blob/main/bbc-headlines.csv). 

Just a simple Python-driven example of @simonw's [Git Scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/). See also See also [autoscraper-mailer](https://github.com/jsoma/autoscraper-mailer), which sends mail, and [autoscraper-changes](https://github.com/jsoma/autoscraper-changes), which only mails if there have been changes.
